    <li class="Harry"> Oliver Phelps, who played George Weasley said “Golf was one of the only sports we were allowed to do in our contract because it was relatively quite safe. We couldn't do any contact sports.”</li>
<li class="Ron"> Rowling’s mother, who had multiple sclerosis, died age 45, after which Rowling suffered from depression. She would use the experience to characterize the Harry Potter’s dementors. Rowling said, “I know sadness. Sadness is to cry and to feel. But it's that cold absence of feeling—that really hollowed-out feeling. That's what Dementors are.”</li>
<li class="Harry"> You might think that the actor who played Moaning Myrtle was around the same age as her character, but you’re wrong!
Shirley Henderson was 36 when she played Moaning Myrtle, the bathroom-haunting ghost of a 14-year-old student who was killed by a basilisk’s stare in Chamber of Secrets.</li>
<li class="Ron"> Snape was reportedly based, at least in part, on John Nettleship, who taught Rowling chemistry and employed her mother as an assistant at Wyedean School near Chepstow. Rowling based Snape's given name on "Severus Road" in Clapham, and his surname is borrowed from the name of a village in England.</li>

<li class="Harry"> J.K. Rowling posted information about how Ginny Weasley decided to follow her passion full-time and become a professional Quidditch player on the website she formed that would continually add to the lore of the Harry Potter franchise.
After Ginny retired from professional Quidditch, she decided to report on her favourite sport. When it came to broadcasting her thoughts on the sport she loved, she thought that The Daily Prophet would be the best place to share her thoughts.</li>
<li class="Ron"> Months after the film’s release, Russian lawyers threatened a lawsuit against Warner Bros. This was for basing Dobby on the image of Russia’s president Vladimir Putin. Dobby’s ears were based on those of a dog called Max, who would sit under the designer of Dobby’s desks.</li>
