    <h2>Some interesting facts and secrets that you did not know about the wedding dress of the Princess of Great Britain</h2>
    <p>Like a real-life fairy tale, Princess Diana arrived to her wedding ceremony to  in a horse-drawn carriage. There was just one issue: the 25-foot train on her bridal gown didn't quite fit. The train had to be "folded like a bedsheet" to make it inside ... resulting in wrinkles as she entered St. Paul's Cathedral. </p>

<li> Designers Elizabeth and David Emanuel knew details of Diana's wedding dress couldn't leak to the press before the big day. They would even create "false trails" by putting the wrong fabrics in the garbage for the press to find, according to Royal Style in the Making exhibit curator Matthew Storey. </li>
<li>Keeping with tradition, Princess Diana wore something old (antique lace from Queen Mary), something new (the dress itself), something borrowed (the Spencer family tiara) and something blue (a bow inside the bodice).</li>
<li>The Emanuels were prepared for any scenario, even a wedding day accident. They created an extra skirt should something spill on the dress ... and even had an entire backup gown ready to be completed in case the design was leaked before the big day.</li>   
<li>The silk taffeta of Diana's dress was specially woven and dyed ivory rather than pure white.</li>
<li>Although it wasn't visible in photographs, there was a hidden good luck charm in Diana's dress: an 18-carat gold horseshoe trinket studded with white diamonds.</li>
